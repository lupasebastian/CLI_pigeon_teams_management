# CLI_pigeon_teams_management

This is a simple yet very useful CLI application that allows any user to neatly organize their pigeons into teams. 
It implements both saving and loading objects from files using jsonpickle format as well as adding them to a database created with sqlalchemy.
Then the database gets querried and saved into jsonpickle format.
I'm quite sure it can be done in somewhat more efficient way, but it seems nice to put those two functionalities together.
It has been quite thoroughly tested manually, awaits automated functional tests, but I simply can't keep all the users waiting.

Whatever would they do with their pigeons? Leave them not organized?
